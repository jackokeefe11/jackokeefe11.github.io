                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p> I am Jack O'Keefe and I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I am a third-year student 
                    at Northwestern Unviversity studying computer science and data science. Some of my main interests include 
                    surfing, skiing, and finding good restaurants to eat at. 
                    I transferred to Northwestern from Vanderbilt University in the fall of 2021, and I have been enjoying my time at Northwestern!
