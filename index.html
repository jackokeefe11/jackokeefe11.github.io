                    <h5> Description </h5>
                    <p> This project is about analyzing the data present about climate change utilizing the 
                        Python programming language. More specifically, the data is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is 
                        about the global temperature. The data is from 1930 to 20222 and is in the form of a CSV file. The data is analyzed using the Pandas
                        library and the results are displayed in various data visualizations.

                    <h5> Description </h5>
                    <p> Frogger was created using C++ and the Northwestern GE211 game library. 
                        It is a remake of the classic arcade game, and has all of the functions in the original.
                        The player is able to control the frog through treacherous terrian, which first includes crossing a road, 
                        and then crossing a river with moving logs and static lillypads. There are multiple levels, with each level becoming 
                        progressively more difficult.
